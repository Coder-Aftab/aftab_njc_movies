creating dir_details table which will contain only director name
```
create table dir_details(dir_id bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY, dir_name character varying, constraint dir_pkey PRIMARY KEY(dir_id));
```

creating cast_detials table which will contain lead actor and actress names
```
create table
cast_details
(cast_id bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
cast_mv_id bigint,
cast_lead_actor character varying,
cast_lead_actress character varying, constraint cast_pkey PRIMARY KEY(cast_id), constraint cast_mv_ukey UNIQUE (cast_mv_id));

```
need to make cast_mv_id as foreign key of mv_id of movies_detail table so will do that after creating movies_detail table

creating table movies_detail which will contain the movie name and release date

```
create table
movies_details
(mv_id bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
mv_cast_id bigint,
mv_dir_id bigint,
mv_name character varying,
mv_rel_dt DATE,
constraint mv_pkey PRIMARY KEY(mv_id),
constraint fk_mv_cast_id_to_cast_id FOREIGN KEY(mv_cast_id) REFERENCES cast_details(cast_id),
constraint fk_mv_dir_id_to_dir_id FOREIGN KEY(mv_dir_id) REFERENCES dir_details(dir_id));

```

now altering cast_mv_id as foreign key to movies_details.mv_id 
```
alter table cast_details 
add constraint cast_mv_fk FOREIGN KEY(cast_mv_id) REFERENCES movies_details(mv_id);
```
